# The Public Investors Advocate Bar Association (PIABA)

The Public Investors Advocate Bar Association (PIABA) was founded in 1990 as a national organization of investment fraud lawyers dedicated to representing investors in disputes with the securities industry. Its membership primarily consists of investment fraud lawyers who specialize in securities arbitration and litigation who advocate on behalf of individual investors. PIABA’s mission encompasses several key objectives aimed at promoting fairness in alternative dispute resolution, advocating for investor rights, enriching community and professional development, and educating the public about investment-related issues.

## Advocacy and Representation

PIABA investment fraud lawyers serve as prominent advocates for fairness in resolving disputes between investors and securities industry professionals, including brokerage firms, registered investment advisors, and financial institutions. The association’s members provide legal representation to investors in arbitration proceedings and other forums where disputes are resolved outside of traditional courtrooms. PIABA investment fraud lawyers and attorneys offer expertise in navigating the complexities of investment disputes, aiming to achieve the best outcomes for their clients.

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

PIABA is committed to growing its diverse membership. PIABA has a longstanding commitment to diversity through eliminating bias and enhancing inclusion in the organization, among the investment community, and the legal profession.

By fostering an inclusive environment, PIABA aims to build a stronger, more equitable legal community that reflects the diversity of the society it serves.

## Promoting Investor Rights

PIABA also promotes investor rights through legislative advocacy and regulatory engagement. The association actively monitors and seeks to influence legislative and regulatory developments that impact investor protections and the fairness of the securities industry. Our advocacy involves supporting and proposing legislation, submitting comments on regulatory proposals, and participating in industry discussions to ensure that investor interests are adequately represented.

## Education and Awareness

PIABA is committed to educating investors and the public about their rights and the risks associated with investing. Through educational initiatives, publications, and outreach efforts, the association’s investment fraud lawyers seek to empower investors with knowledge to make informed decisions and to recognize potential misconduct in the financial services industry. Educational programs may cover topics such as understanding investment products, recognizing investment fraud, and navigating the arbitration process.
