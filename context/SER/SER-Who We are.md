# Who We Are and What We Do

## Our Mission Statement

Established in 1993, and incorporated in 2005 as a non-profit 501c(6), SER is an expert witness member organization that provides continuing professional education and promotes ethics and integrity among its members while remaining dispute neutral as an organization.

## Our Membership

Members are consulting and testifying expert witnesses that have solid academic credentials and career accomplishments as Financial and Securities Industry Professionals, Former Securities Regulators, Attorneys, and CPAs. They exchange ideas, experience, knowledge, and approaches to the myriad of issues encountered in our profession and cross-refer cases at no cost. Members provide services individually and not under SER's umbrella. They are retained on behalf of Banks, Broker-Dealers, RIAs, Registered Reps and Investment Advisors, Companies, Professional Groups, Foundations, Directors, Families, and Individuals.

SER encourages its members to adopt SER Best Practices of ethics and integrity, and its motto - "Seek and Speak the Truth" - is our behavioral touchstone. An annual summer member conference, a dedicated website, ongoing member education, and networking are the primary tools SER employs to maintain its premier position in the expert witness field. Membership in SER offers a unique opportunity for professional development, peer collaboration, and industry insights—different and complementary to expert referral groups, which many of our members are also connected.

## A Resource to Attorneys

SER is a resource for attorneys seeking neutral Arbitrators, Mediators, and Consulting and Testifying Experts to assist in resolving disputes. Experts assist attorneys at all stages of litigation from defining the issues at hand, filing or answering the Statement of Claim, with direct settlement negotiations, at mediation, before Regulators, in Federal and State Court and Arbitration. Attorneys can search for, contact, and engage SER experts directly on our website. Members provide services individually and not under SER's umbrella. SER takes no part in the expert's fee or engagements. (If you prefer to send a message out to all experts, contact Patricia Koetting @ controller@securitiesexperts.org for assistance.)
