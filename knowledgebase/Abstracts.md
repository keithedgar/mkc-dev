## Publications – Pension & Fiduciary Focus

### "TIME, for a Change"
**Publication:** *The Texas Pension Observer* | **Date:** Fall 2012

**Abstract:** This article examines the temporal dimensions of investment decision-making for public pension funds, arguing that trustees must balance short-term market conditions against long-term liability obligations. The analysis addresses how time horizons should influence asset allocation policy, rebalancing frequency, and performance evaluation periods. The paper critiques the tendency of fiduciaries to overreact to recent market movements while underweighting secular trends affecting plan funded status.

**Relevance to PIABA/SER Practice:** Provides framework for evaluating whether pension fiduciaries appropriately considered investment time horizons. Supports analysis in cases where trustees allegedly made imprudent short-term decisions inconsistent with long-term plan obligations.

**Co-author:** R. Neumann

**Abstract:** An empirical study analyzing the effectiveness of capital control policies implemented by Latin American countries during periods of financial liberalization. The research employs econometric methods to evaluate whether controls achieved their stated policy objectives of reducing capital flow volatility and protecting domestic financial systems. Findings indicate mixed results, with control effectiveness dependent on implementation design and broader macroeconomic conditions.

### "Compositional Effects of Capital Controls – Theory and Evidence"
**Publication:** *The World Economy: The Americas* | **Volume:** 26 | **Date:** August 2003  
**Co-author:** R. Neumann  
**Citation:** Campion, M.K. and Neumann, R.M. (2003), World Economy, 26: 957-973. https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9701.00558

**Abstract:** This paper examines the effects of capital controls on the composition of international capital flows, paying particular attention to debt inflows versus equity inflows. A two-period small open economy model with stochastic second-period output and asymmetric information between domestic agents and international financiers is utilized to generate predictions regarding the effects of capital controls on the relative use of debt versus equity for financing first-period investment. These capital control implications are then investigated with quarterly frequency panel data for Latin America. Capital controls are found to significantly affect the composition of the capital account.

**Relevance to PIABA/SER Practice:** Establishes expertise in financial economics, international capital flows, and quantitative modeling. The research methodology—combining theoretical modeling with empirical testing—demonstrates the analytical rigor applied to expert witness engagements.
