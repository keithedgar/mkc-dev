## Publications – Pension & Fiduciary Focus

### "TIME, for a Change"
**Publication:** *The Texas Pension Observer* | **Date:** Fall 2012

**Abstract:** This article examines the temporal dimensions of investment decision-making for public pension funds, arguing that trustees must balance short-term market conditions against long-term liability obligations. The analysis addresses how time horizons should influence asset allocation policy, rebalancing frequency, and performance evaluation periods. The paper critiques the tendency of fiduciaries to overreact to recent market movements while underweighting secular trends affecting plan funded status.

**Relevance to PIABA/SER Practice:** Provides framework for evaluating whether pension fiduciaries appropriately considered investment time horizons. Supports analysis in cases where trustees allegedly made imprudent short-term decisions inconsistent with long-term plan obligations.

### "Should Secular Trends Cause Changes in AA Policy?"

The article evaluates the tension between maintaining policy discipline and adapting to changed market conditions. Recommendations include establishing systematic review triggers while avoiding reactive allocation changes driven by recent performance.

**Relevance to PIABA/SER Practice:** Establishes expertise in asset allocation policy governance. Informs expert analysis of whether fiduciaries appropriately reviewed and updated investment policies in response to material market changes or imprudently adhered to outdated assumptions.

The analysis defends MPT's core diversification principles while acknowledging limitations in extreme market conditions. Recommendations include stress testing, scenario analysis, and recognition that historical correlations may not hold during market crises.

**Relevance to PIABA/SER Practice:** Critical for evaluating fiduciary decisions made during and after the financial crisis. Supports expert testimony on whether reliance on MPT-based strategies was prudent and whether fiduciaries appropriately understood and disclosed model limitations.

## Academic Publications – Economics & Finance

### "An Empirical Investigation of Controls in Latin America"
**Publication:** *The North America Journal of Economics and Finance* | **Volume:** 14, No. 2 | **Date:** 2004  
**Co-author:** R. Neumann

**Abstract:** An empirical study analyzing the effectiveness of capital control policies implemented by Latin American countries during periods of financial liberalization. The research employs econometric methods to evaluate whether controls achieved their stated policy objectives of reducing capital flow volatility and protecting domestic financial systems. Findings indicate mixed results, with control effectiveness dependent on implementation design and broader macroeconomic conditions.

**Relevance to PIABA/SER Practice:** Demonstrates rigorous quantitative research methodology and expertise in international capital markets. Supports credibility as an expert witness capable of sophisticated empirical analysis in complex financial disputes.

---

### "Compositional Effects of Capital Controls – Theory and Evidence"
**Publication:** *The World Economy: The Americas* | **Volume:** 26 | **Date:** August 2003  
**Co-author:** R. Neumann  
**Citation:** Campion, M.K. and Neumann, R.M. (2003), World Economy, 26: 957-973. https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9701.00558

**Abstract:** This paper examines the effects of capital controls on the composition of international capital flows, paying particular attention to debt inflows versus equity inflows. A two-period small open economy model with stochastic second-period output and asymmetric information between domestic agents and international financiers is utilized to generate predictions regarding the effects of capital controls on the relative use of debt versus equity for financing first-period investment. These capital control implications are then investigated with quarterly frequency panel data for Latin America. Capital controls are found to significantly affect the composition of the capital account.

**Relevance to PIABA/SER Practice:** Establishes expertise in financial economics, international capital flows, and quantitative modeling. The research methodology—combining theoretical modeling with empirical testing—demonstrates the analytical rigor applied to expert witness engagements.

**Relevance to PIABA/SER Practice:** Provides foundation for expert testimony on investment return assumptions and portfolio construction methodology.
